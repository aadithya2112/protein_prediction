Data Preview
The dataset contains protein information with:

Entry: Protein identifier (e.g., A0A009IHW8)
Length: Protein sequence length in amino acids
EC number: Enzyme classification numbers
Keywords: Functional descriptions and properties
Gene Ontology: Molecular function annotations
The trimmed file is ready for analysis and contains a representative sample of 2,000 proteins from the full dataset of ~554k proteins. The data appears to be well-structured and complete despite the curl connection issue you experienced during download.
